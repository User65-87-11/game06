fog of war as a layer on top of a map that makes everything darken
	- it has to be represented by intensity map with range of 5
	- should be drawn on top of map and non-emitting objects
	- then the player, lights, firebolts
	- there is a light source with 0.1 intensity
	- light emitting objects produce intensity areas
fog of war rains 

tiles come up as one steps
 - sometimes tiles dont come up at every step untill the last
 - sometimes tiles shouldnt come up and the player should fall
 - mobs always have tiles under them

light is the camera direction
 - somewhere 

player 
 - can chose to fall through 
 - at some random position
 - dealing fall damage to 1 tile around
 - can walk N only if can walk NE+NW
 - players can blend colors
 - teleportations
 - representation of player? 
 - tank with something inside
 - slides as ice
 - boils as fire
 - cracks as rock
 


map waypoints
 - rooms have entrences
 - if it's not in direct line vision follow waypoints
 - predefined movement routes


what is animation
 - animation takes variable amount of seconds to complete
 - 2 types of animations
	- transition from A to B
	- active state expression animation
	- are they the same?
- interrupted animation
- examples
	-moving from tile A to B
		- new position can be set only after 0.5 seconds
		- new position is reserved for the one who started moving
		- can be interrupted to go back 
		- animation shows movement towards tile B but the actual position wont change
		- position isn't dependent on animation only on game logic

	-movement animation is A -> animate 0.5 -> B
- implementation
	anim_duration = 1.0 sec
	anim_start_time
	anim_end_time = anim_start_time + anim_duration;
	last_frame_time
	anim_total_frames = 8
	anim_current_frame = 1
	anim_fps = anim_total_frames / anim_duration;
	
	- next frame
	anim_current_frame = last_frame_time / anim_duration
	last_frame_time = 1/60 

- happenings 
	- have start and everyoen checks it's own time
